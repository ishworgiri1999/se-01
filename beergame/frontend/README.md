## Frontend SETUP 

Use the package  manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies.



uses babel to convert jsx to js functions and webpack to compile codes to one js file that can be attached to index.html

```bash
#Frontend Directory 
cd frontend
#Install Dependencies
npm install


```
#Compile React Codes using Webpack and watch for changes
execute this command in some terminal and run it in the background 
```
npm run dev
```


#Compile React Codes using Webpack for Production Version
once done with everything and the frontend no longer needs any 
changes final build can be created using this command
```
npm run build
```


## NOTE
You don`t have to run npm commands to serve the website .
Just run python command to serve the website and it will use the last compressed version the javascript file.


# Test cases
Only checks for .tests.js files 
```
npm test
```
